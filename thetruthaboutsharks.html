<h2 class=heading2> <a name = "#sharkattack"></a>Shark Attack Facts 
</h2>
Out of the 200 million Americans who swim at the beach every year yet only about 36 are even attacked by sharks with less than 4 fatalities. Considering the large amount of beach-goers, instances of shark attacks are very rare. Since 2006, only about 4 fatal shark attacks have occurred per year worldwide. In the US only 3 of the 179 shark attacks were fatal. Meanwhile elephants and tigers collectively kill about 100 people per year. Any beach vacationer has about a 1 in 3.5 million chance of drowning- which means any beach-goer is about 20 times more likely to die from drowning than from a shark attack.
